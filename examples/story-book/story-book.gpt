description: Writes a children's book and generates illustrations for it.
args: story: The story to write and illustrate. Can be a prompt or a complete story.
args: pages: The number of pages to generate

Do the following steps sequentially:

1. Create the `pages` directory inside the `templates` directory if it does not already exist.
2. If ${story} is a prompt and not a complete children's story, call story-writer
   to write a story based on the prompt.
3. Take ${story} and break it up into ${pages} logical "pages" of text.
4. For each page:
   - Call story-illustrator to illustrate it. Be sure to include any relevant characters to include when 
     asking it to illustrate the page.
   - Download the illustration to a file at pages/<page_number>.png.
5. For each page and its illustration write an html file with the text on top and image below it to pages/page<page number>.html.
   Assume the illustration file is a sibling to the html file, Add this style tag to the HTML file:
   ```html
   <style>
      body {
         display: flex;
         flex-direction: column;
         justify-content: center;
         align-items: center;
         text-align: center;
      }

      img {
         max-width: 100%;
         height: auto;
         margin-bottom: 5%
      }

      p {
         margin: 5%;
         font-size: 24px;
      }
   </style>
   ```
6. Edit the "pages" variable array in story.html to serve the pages you created. Do not 
   edit anything else. Do not edit the page select field.

description: Generates a illustration for a children's story
args: text: The text of the page to illustrate

Think of a good prompt to generate an image to represent $text. Make sure to
include the name of any relevant characters in your prompt. Then use that prompt to 
generate an illustration. Append any prompt that you have with ". In an pointilism cartoon
children's book style with no text in it". Only return the URL of the illustration.
